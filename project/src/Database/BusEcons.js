      question_number: 1,
      question_text:
        "In which form of the market structure is the degree of control over the price of its product by a firm very large?",
      options: {
        A: "Monopoly",
        B: "Trading",
        C: "Monopolistic Competition",
        D: "Perfect competition",
      },
      correct_answer: "A",
      explanation:
        "In a monopoly market structure, a single firm has complete control over the supply of a product with no close substitutes. This gives the monopolist significant power to set prices, as consumers have no alternative suppliers to turn to.",
    },
    {
      question_number: 2,
      question_text:
        "Which one of the following is the condition of equilibrium for the monopolist?",
      options: {
        A: "MR = MC",
        B: "MC = AR",
        C: "MR = MC = Price",
        D: "AC = AR",
      },
      correct_answer: "A",
      explanation:
        "A monopolist maximizes profit where marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC). Unlike perfect competition, the monopolist's price is greater than marginal revenue due to the downward-sloping demand curve.",
    },
    {
      question_number: 3,
      question_text:
        "Which of the following is not an essential condition of pure competition?",
      options: {
        A: "Large number of buyers and sellers",
        B: "Homogeneous product",
        C: "Freedom of entry",
        D: "Downward sloping demand curve",
      },
      correct_answer: "D",
      explanation:
        "In perfect competition, individual firms face a perfectly elastic (horizontal) demand curve, not a downward-sloping one. The downward-sloping demand curve is characteristic of imperfect competition where firms have some market power.",

      },
      correct_answer: "B",
      explanation:
        "Normative economics deals with value judgments and opinions about what economic policies or outcomes should be. It contrasts with positive economics, which focuses on facts and cause-and-effect relationships.",

        C: "Negative",
        D: "Infinite",
      },
      correct_answer: "C",
      explanation:
        "For inferior goods, as income increases, demand decreases. This creates a negative relationship between income and quantity demanded, resulting in a negative income elasticity of demand.",

      question_number: 6,
      question_text: "Which of the following is Microeconomics concerned with?",
      options: {

        A: "Inelastic",
        B: "Unit elastic",
        C: "Elastic",
        D: "Perfectly inelastic",
      },
      correct_answer: "D",
      explanation:
        "When quantity demanded does not change at all regardless of price changes, demand is perfectly inelastic. This represents a vertical demand curve with zero price elasticity of demand.",
    },
    {
      question_number: 8,
      question_text: "The following are causes of shift in demand EXCEPT:",
      options: {

        B: "Change in price",
        C: "Change in fashion",
        D: "Change in prices of substitutes",
      },
      correct_answer: "B",
      explanation:
        "A change in the price of the good itself causes a movement along the demand curve, not a shift of the entire demand curve. Shifts in demand are caused by changes in non-price factors like income, tastes, prices of related goods, etc.",

        D: "The law of demand has been violated",
      },
      correct_answer: "B",
      explanation:
        "When total expenditure remains constant regardless of price changes, the price elasticity of demand equals 1 (unit elastic). This means the percentage change in quantity demanded exactly equals the percentage change in price.",

      },
      correct_answer: "B",
      explanation:
        "When money demand exceeds money supply, there is excess demand for money. This creates upward pressure on interest rates as people are willing to pay more (higher interest rates) to obtain the scarce money.",

      question_text:
        "The price of a perfect competition firm is same as the firm's:",
      options: {
        A: "Average fixed cost",
        B: "Average variable cost",
        C: "Marginal cost",
        D: "Total cost",
      },
      correct_answer: "C",
      explanation:
        "In perfect competition, firms are price takers and maximize profit where P = MC. At the profit-maximizing output level, price equals marginal cost, which is the condition for allocative efficiency.",
    },

      question_number: 74,
      question_text:
        "The price charged by a monopoly for a unit of its product is the same as the firm's:",
      options: {
        A: "Average revenue",
        B: "Marginal revenue",
        C: "Total revenue",
        D: "Demand curve",
      },
      correct_answer: "A",
      explanation:
        "Price per unit always equals average revenue (AR = Total Revenue Ã· Quantity). For a monopolist, price also represents the height of the demand curve at any given quantity, but the fundamental relationship is P = AR.",
    },

      question_number: 75,
      question_text:
        "If marginal cost exceeds marginal revenue, a price-taker firm should:",
      options: {
        A: "Expand output",
        B: "Lower price",
        C: "Reduce output",
        D: "Shut down",
      },
      correct_answer: "C",
      explanation:
        "When MC > MR, the cost of producing an additional unit exceeds the revenue it generates. The firm should reduce output until MC = MR to maximize profit. A price-taker cannot change price.",
    },

      question_number: 76,
      question_text:
        "As a result of a 10% fall in price of good X, the demand for its substitute, good Y, falls by 20%. The cross elasticity of demand for good Y with respect to the price of good X is:",
      options: {
        A: "-2.0",
        B: "-0.5",
        C: "+0.5",
        D: "+2.0",
      },
      correct_answer: "D",
      explanation:
        "Cross elasticity = (% change in quantity demanded of Y) / (% change in price of X) = (-20%) / (-10%) = +2.0. The positive sign confirms they are substitutes.",
