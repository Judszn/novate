        D: "Spencer v Harding (1870) L. R. 5CP 561",
      },
      correct_answer: "C",
      explanation:
        "Routlege v Grant (1828) 4 Bing 653 is not an invitation to treat case but rather a case about offer and acceptance. The other cases (Pharmaceutical Society v. Boots, Fisher v Bell, and Spencer v Harding) are all classic invitation to treat cases that establish the principle that certain displays and advertisements are invitations to treat rather than offers.",

        "Where an agreement is made in a commercial context, what is the general rule relating to intention to create legal relations?",
      options: {
        A: "Commercial agreements are never legal binding because the parties cannot create legal relations.",
        B: "All social or domestic agreements are legally binding.",
        C: "The courts presume the parties did not intend to create legal relations.",
        D: "The courts presume the parties intended to create legal relations.",
      },
      correct_answer: "D",
      explanation:
        "In commercial contexts, there is a rebuttable presumption that parties intended to create legal relations. This is opposite to social and domestic agreements where the presumption is that parties did not intend to create legal relations. This presumption reflects the business nature of commercial transactions.",

        "The court in the case of NTHC Ltd v Yaa Antwi (2009) SCGLR 117, held that an offer is an indication in words or by conduct by an offeror that he or she is prepared to be bound by a contract in the terms expressed in the offer. This statement is",
      options: {
        A: "True - this accurately defines an offer",

        C: "False - this defines acceptance",
        D: "True - but only for written offers",
      },
      correct_answer: "A",
      explanation:
        "This statement is true and accurately defines an offer. The definition provided correctly reflects the legal concept of an offer as established in NTHC Ltd v Yaa Antwi. An offer is indeed an indication (whether in words or by conduct) that shows the offeror's willingness to be bound by the terms they have expressed, regardless of whether it's written or oral.",

        B: "Relevant test",
        C: "Objective test",
        D: "Reasonable businessman test",
      },
      correct_answer: "B",
      explanation:
        "Courts do not apply the 'relevant test' because this is not a recognized legal test. Courts use the objective test (reasonable man test) to determine parties' intentions, looking at what a reasonable person would understand from the parties' words and conduct rather than their subjective intentions.",

      },
      correct_answer: "A",
      explanation:

This case is particularly important for unilateral contracts.",

      correct_answer: "D",
      explanation:
        "The intention to create legal relations is not presumed to exist in social and domestic agreements, including agreements between friends or family members. This is opposite to commercial agreements where such intention is presumed.",

      correct_answer: "B",
      explanation:

      correct_answer: "C",
      explanation:
        "A valid offer cannot be terminated by misplacement of a letter. Offers can be terminated by lapse of time, death of a party, or rejection (whether express or implied). Misplacement of communication does not affect the validity of the offer itself.",

      },
      correct_answer: "A",

        D: "Generally, part-payment of a debt does not constitute sufficient consideration",
      },
      correct_answer: "A",
      explanation:
        "The statement that 'Performance of a contractual duty owed to a third party does not amount to good consideration' is untrue. Performance of a contractual duty owed to a third party can constitute good consideration because it provides a benefit to the promisee and involves a detriment to the promisor.

Acceptance can be communicated by various means including oral, written, email, or conduct, depending on the circumstances and what the offeror specifies. The postal rule is just one specific rule that applies when acceptance is sent by post, but it's not a requirement that acceptance must be by post.",
