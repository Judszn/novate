      },
      correct_answer: "B",
      explanation:
        "The three main types of computer programming languages are classified based on their level of abstraction: machine language (binary code), assembly language (low-level symbolic representation), and high-level language (human-readable programming languages like C++, Java, Python).",

      },
      correct_answer: "C",
      explanation:

      explanation:
        "Constants in C++ are also known as literals. Literals are fixed values that cannot be changed during program execution, such as 42 (integer literal), 3.14 (floating-point literal), or 'A' (character literal).",

      correct_answer: "B",
      explanation:
        "The switch statement is also called a selective structure because it allows the program to select one of many code blocks to execute based on the value of an expression.",

      correct_answer: "B",
      explanation:
        "The logical OR operator (||) returns false only when both operands are false. In all other cases (true||true, true||false, false||true), it returns true.",

      explanation:
        'In C++, string constants (string literals) are enclosed in double quotes ("). Single quotes are used for character literals, while double quotes are used for string literals.',

        "X++ is the post-increment operator that adds 1 to the value of X. It increments X by 1 after using its current value in the expression.",
